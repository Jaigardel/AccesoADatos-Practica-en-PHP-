üì¢ Project: Company Database with Role-Based Access

This project is an extension of a previously developed company management system. The goal is to implement user authentication and role-based access control to restrict permissions based on user roles.

üîπ Objectives

Implement authentication to restrict access to authorized users only.

Establish role-based permissions for different user types.

Use PDO for database interactions.

Secure password storage with encryption.

Implement session management with login/logout functionality.
